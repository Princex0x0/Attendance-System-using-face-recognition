# Attendance-System-using-face-recognition
This is an end semester project on Attendance System using Face recognition.
This is typical end semester project given by my college. 
i have provided a full descriptive copy along with code.
i have used pycharm(IDE) and mysql database.
NOTE:- to able to undersand this project a prerequisite is to have a brief knowledge of python and some intermediary in mysql.


step 1:

install pycharm(IDE) community version

step 2:

install mysql along with its various modules provided by default.

STEP 3:

open the pdf file i have provided and read carefully all the dependencies.

install all the modules in sequence.( I know you may face difficulties in installing modules)

:::: if you are not using IDE  then you can just intall by using pip install (module)    in terminal or python application.

::: if you are using pycharm then there is benifit you. pycharm install required moldules in code by himself. Only one thing you have to do is to click on left corner where the IDE showing you an error and install module.

STEP 4:

this is to run the overall project.

select a python interpreter with installed module and run the project.



KEEP IN MIND CODING IS A FRUSTRATING JOURNEY TO THOSE YOU ARE JUST WANT TO RUN PROJECT.

BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PATIENCE AND WANT TO PUSH THEMSELVES BEYOND LIMITS THEY ENJOY THIS JOURNEY.
